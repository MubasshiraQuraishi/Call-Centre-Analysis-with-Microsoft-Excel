ðŸ“Š **Excel Dashboard: Call Center Performance Analysis**

I created this dashboard based on a Call Center dataset found on Kaggle, using **Pivot Tables** and **Excel formulas** to design a clear, interactive report.

ðŸ”¹ The dashboard showcases key metrics like:

* **Total Calls**
* **Average Call Duration**
* **Total Talk Time**
* **Average CSAT Score**

ðŸ”¹ It also includes visuals for:

* Call distribution by city
* Daily call trends
* Customer satisfaction score distribution
* Channel-wise call breakdown (Call Center, Chatbot, Email, Web)
* Sentiment analysis (Positive vs. Negative)

ðŸ”¹ I added **slicers for City and State** to enable dynamic filtering across all visuals.

ðŸ’¡ Initially, I was stuck calculating dynamic KPIs, but I solved it using **GETPIVOTDATA**, helper columns, and conditional logic. This allowed the KPIs to respond to slicer selections seamlessly.

This dashboard gives a comprehensive view of the call center's daily activity, customer feedback, and service performanceâ€”all built in Excel.
